# PromptEngineering
Prompt engineering is the art of writing instructions for AI models in a way that they can understand and follow. It is used to instruct the model on what to do, provide the model with context, constrain the model's output, and encourage the model to be creative.

To write effective prompts, be as specific as possible, use keywords and phrases that are relevant to the task at hand, be clear about your expectations, and be patient and keep experimenting.
